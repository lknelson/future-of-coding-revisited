    "example_articles = \"\"\"Input: Blame Game An unalterable truth in Washington is that everything is about the next election--as President Bush is about to find out in the upcoming battle of the budget. In the Clinton era, budget wars were rollicking political brawls with defining consequences. The best and most obvious example: the government shutdown of 1995. With the economy lagging, the surplus evaporating, and the Democrats controlling the Senate, President Bush enters his first budget fight with fewer advantages than he held on Inauguration Day. Soon he must confront the reality that while the budget deals with the nitty-gritty of collecting and spending some $ 2 trillion annually, it also provides a grand stage for unsubtle overtures to voters, who go to the polls next year to elect all 435 members of the House and more than a third of the Senate. With three prominent GOP senators announcing their retirement from the closely divided Senate, Republicans have 20 seats to defend, while Democrats have only 14 incumbents up for re-election. With the planned departures of Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms, and Phil Gramm, the Republican task of retaking the Senate grows more daunting by the day. A Democrat-controlled Senate in 2002 means that President Bush will go into his own re-election two years later with South Dakota Democrat Tom Daschle as majority leader, one who could derail the White House's agenda. Reveling in a sooner than expected bout of I-told-you-so, Democrats point to the dwindling federal budget surplus and warn that the Bush administration will be forced to break its campaign pledge that it would not use Social Security taxes for anything other than Social Security benefits. Daschle has been adroitly laying the foundation for blame. \"Certainly, they are the architects of our current economic condition, and I think we have to turn to them for leadership now as we find our way out of this box that has been created,\" he says. The pressure points are obvious. Bush has requested an additional $ 18.3 billion for defense. There has been little progress on how to fund the president's educational reform package. His energy plan is unresolved. On the other side, Democrats want to increase the minimum wage, which most in the GOP oppose if there aren't tax breaks for small businesses. And the Democrats want a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which could cost $ 300 billion over the next decade. Bush defends his budget by saying that it could accommodate his cherished tax cut and other proposals if only Congress could restrain its chronic tendencies toward spending. But those wise to Washington's ways also know that spending has its virtues. After all, many of the millions spent on so-called pet projects will figure prominently in the political stump speeches during the next election cycle. Output: Yes.\n",
