For the American consumer, events of the last few weeks have flashed by like one more chapter of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Is it possible that in two months we have been cured of the deadly illness that made it necessary to cage the money supply, propel interest rates sky-high and dry up charge buying? Can Treasury Secretary Miller really mean it when he says that ''we have so remarkably corrected the inflationary psychology''? By impressive coincidence, the Federal Reserve Board's downer for interest rates and Miller's call for citizens to ''go back to normal consumer behavior''--whatever that is-- happened at the same time as the announcement that the rise in the consumer price index had slowed. In April, growth of the CPI dropped off from the 18.1 percent annual rate of the three previous months to an annual 11.4. Are we, then, out of the woods? Has the acceleration of price rises miraculously been halted? Another month may provide a clue, but it is hard to find such a clue in the current CPI. Half the slowdown is credited to stability of gasoline prices, a respite that no one expects to last, and much of the rest came from an easing of the rise in food costs, which, we already have been warned  economists, will soon go up again. The embattled CPI, in fact, bears responsibility for much of our inflationary woe. It forms the basis for escalation in a variety of government payments and serves as a prime criterion in wage raises. For some time now, it has been under attack on the grounds that it does not measure the right costs and, for instance, should not determine the extent of periodic boosts in Social Security checks because retired people do not customarily buy a lot of new cars and homes and other such expensive goods. Also, a less noticed end run around the CPI enhances unreality in the U.S. economy. Many prices are, surprisingly, being cut from their listed levels, but in ways that escape the index and fail to assuage public anguish. Officials of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which prepares the CPI, declare frankly that there is no way they can measure effects from the flood of cents-off coupons. These now, according to the Nielsen Clearing House, are used by some 60 million American families. Price cuts through this means, totaling perhaps 1 billion dollars a year, do not appear in the official record. Moreover, although the BLS does monitor the result of rebates on automobiles, it cannot cope with all the money that may be put back into the buyer's hand on the purchase of a host of other appliances from toasters to washing machines. There is nothing immoral or unpatriotic about coupons and rebates. If that is the only way people are going to get a price break, so be it. But, since their impact cannot be put into the equation, a suggestion is heard that the time has come for U.S. businessmen to abandon those devices and turn to outright cuts, as a significant help in interrupting the inflationary drift. The hope is that if one big company will make the first move, widespread reductions may follow. A major deterrent is said to be the fear that price controls will eventually be applied, trapping those businesses whose prices are down.""

New evidence of a productivity boom For years, believers in the so-called new economy have been bedeviled by a stubborn statistic: Despite America's massive investment in new technology, which seemed to promise a bounteous new era of rapid growth, high efficiency, and low inflation, official measures of gains in productivity have shown little improvement, remaining far below the rates of the 1950s and '60s. But last week, the case for the new economy received a big boost. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the amount American workers produced during each hour on the job surged at an annualized rate of 3.7 percent during the last quarter of 1998. If the current rate is sustained, American workers 20 years from now will be able to produce more in just one year than today's worker does in two. That would make our children rich indeed, but there is reason to be skeptical. Some experts believe the new numbers are artificially skewed by technical factors, such as changes in the way inflation is calculated. Others doubt that the productivity boom, even if real, can be sustained. ""I think it is entirely premature to conclude that we have entered into a new technology-led prosperity that will drive productivity up forever,"" says Stephen C. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co. Another reason for caution: Most of the productivity gains occurred in manufacturing, which accounts for a shrinking share of the economy.""
