Based on the provided document, here are the bullet points that define what makes an article "irrelevant":

* The article is not about the U.S.
* The article is about racial or gender inequality or gay rights in the U.S., but does not mention economic inequality.
* The article mentions popular culture that includes part of a subject term (e.g. a movie named "Big Business"), but does not discuss economic inequality.
* The article discusses clearly personal affairs about a single individual that do not comment on broader conditions.
* The article is about noneconomic elites (e.g. in art or religion or politics), and high economic status is neither implicit nor explicit.
* The article uses social class as a predictor of non-economic phenomenon (e.g. health, education, drug use, social mobility, conspicuous and other kinds of consumption).
* The article discusses famous individuals or criminal cases or cases of corporate or union corruption that are treated as unique situations and do not have any reflection on broader conditions.

Note that if an article mentions trends in economic inequality, income inequality, or has qualifying text on relinequality, relchanges, or releconomy, it will not be considered irrelevant.
