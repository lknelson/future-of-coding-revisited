Based on the provided document, here are the bullet points for the definition of irrelevant articles:

**Irrelevant Articles:**

* Stories that are not about the U.S.
* Articles on racial or gender inequality or gay rights in the U.S. (unless they also mention trends in economic inequality)
* Individuals whose names are part of a subject term (e.g., Marc Rich)
* References to popular culture that include part of a subject term (e.g., a movie named "Big Business")
* Clearly personal affairs about a single individual that do not comment on broader conditions
* Noneconomic elites (e.g., in art or religion or politics, where high economic status is neither implicit nor explicit)
* Social class as a predictor of non-economic phenomenon (e.g., health, education, drug use, social mobility, conspicuous and other kinds of consumption)

Additionally, some articles may be considered irrelevant if they:

* Are about famous individuals or criminal cases or cases of corporate or union corruption that are treated as unique situations and do not have any reflection on broader conditions.
* Do not mention trends in economic inequality, even if they discuss policy or political debates and particular politicians.

Note that these criteria can be overridden if the article also mentions trends in economic inequality or other relevant topics.
