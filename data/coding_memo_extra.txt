 1 CODING NOTES – APPENDICES A, B , C  July 25, 2013  APPENDIX A (“Coding Notes – ljm – 9-27-10.doc”)  McCall Coding Notes from Review of Reliability Tests     Updated in red track changes: June 30, 2010 Updated in blue text: July 29, 2010 Updated in blue text: August 3, 2010 Updated: August 26, 2010; September 27, 2010 Updated: July 25, 2013 (only a few lines that are misleading)  GENERAL CODING NOTES (for 4 main categories of irrelevant, relinequality, relchanges, and releconomy)  Order of coding: if any mention of inequality, or relative differences in income/wealth/wages/compensation/benefits/etc between two or more hierarchically ordered groups, then code as relinequality; then if any mention of wages/earnings/income/benefits/compensation/wealth for any single group or the populatin as a whole, then code as relchanges; then if discusses anything or any indicator (e.g., holiday spending reports, stock market, inflation, interest rates, housing market, cost of living, etc.) related to state of the economy, and especially employment conditions, then code as releconomy. Otherwise, code as irrelevant.   This means that even if an article is mainly about unemployment or a growing or contracting economy but mentions earnings/income with respect to any group (even average American), then it should be coded as relchanges and not releconomy.  An example: taxes are cut during a recession to stimulate the economy but the article also mentions how taxes will increase incomes of average Americans (or any other group), then the article should be coded as relchanges. If the article mentions that the tax cuts are proportionally greater for top than bottom or vice versa, affecting inequality, then it would be coded as relinequality.      The irrelevant category includes all stories that are not on the U.S. or are on racial or gender inequality in the U.S. This will include most articles on affirmative action. If it is on racial/gender inequality and income inequality, then it may be relevant, however. Occasionally there are stories on famous individuals or criminal cases or cases of corporate or union corruption that are unique and don’t have any reflection on broader conditions. In these cases, the article can be coded as irrelevant. It appears that articles in this category were generally coded as irrelevant even if they had one mention of something that fell into one of the three other main categories. Another topic that falls into this category is conservative ideology because “conservatism” is a subject keyword. In other words, a single mention of something that is relevant if the article is entirely on a different topic qualifies it as irrelevant. This is how the previous coders interpreted the coding instructions and this will expedite the coding process.   A lot of articles use “Labor” as subject keyword in conjunction with something else, such as Labor Education or Labor Mobility, so all phrases with Labor will be included. These are generally relevant articles on the job conditions and earnings of workers.     2 Terms like “low-income,” “middle income,” and “high income” are perhaps better coding category titles than working class, middle class, and rich.   Articles about the stock market are relevant in that they discuss income (unearned income) primarily of those at the top end of the distribution (even if this is the top quartile). These articles would most likely be coded as relchanges but could also be relinequality in some instances if other hierarchically related groups are mentioned along with their incomes/earnings/wealth/etc.   Benefits, such as health care and pensions, and even job training when mentioned as a job benefit, should be considered part of compensation because they are part of the “wage bill.” Thus, if things like health care and pensions are cut back, this would be considered a change in earnings/income and thus coded as at least relchanges.   There can be confusion around whether an issue is a “cause” or a “policy mention.” In some instances one coder codes an issue as a cause the other as a policy. It might make sense to aggregate these in the analysis.   Federal Reserve and monetary policy (e.g., changes in interest rates) should be considered part of government regulation. Any regulation of private industry, such as safety and labor standards, environmental standards, job training initiatives, or stimulus spending should also be considered under this heading. Taxes to stimulate research and development or other activities would be considered under the heading of taxes and government regulation.    The future prediction category should be used for coding content related to proposed policy and legislative initiatives (e.g., how a proposed tax bill would affect incomes). It can also be used about some clear prediction about how the economy or incomes or inequality could change in the future (e.g., how robots will change the future of work).   3 SPECIFIC CODING NOTES (numbers refer to the number given to the category on the coding sheet/schema)  2.  Relinequality Rising (whether the article mentions that inequality has risen or is rising or is discussing a policy that has the potential to increase inequality)  Falling (whether the article mentions that  inequality has fallen or is falling or is  discussing a policy with the potential to decrease inequality)   Additional notes: only code if the article mentions inequality is rising or falling or if the  policy or event or issue mentioned implies a rise or fall in inequality if all else remained  the same. For example, if a tax policy is mentioned that raises taxes on the rich but no  one else, then this would lead to a decline in income inequality and you would code as  falling.   3. Relchanges in income/earnings/wage status (whether or not article mentions changes in wages/income/earnings for particular class/income/worker groups but DOES NOT mention gaps between income groups (item 2))  Additional notes: identifies “changes” in “income/earnings/wages” for “groups” as elements defining this category but the most important element is any mention of “income/earnings/wages” or any other form of employment compensation or unearned income (such as from investments) or transfers from the government (such as general tax cuts or increased spending without targeting programs or groups) or transfers from individuals (such as alimony/child support) or wealth (such as income from property). See below for more extended definition of income. In almost all circumstances “changes” are implied but if they are not, and the article is simply about the earnings/income, etc., of a particular group (e.g., the “overclass” or the “knowledge” class or a specific occupational group, however narrowly defined) or even an individual used as an example in an article, then it would qualify under this category as long as earnings/income/etc. are NOT compared to another higher or lower group, which would qualify it as relinequality, or the discussion is NOT of a targeted government transfer or tax program (such as unemployment benefits or tax cuts for specific groups or the minimum wage), which also qualifies it as relinequality. Thus “changes” and “groups” (i.e., as in large classes or occupations) are not essential to the definition of this category.   References to jobs and jobs alone, such as gaining jobs or losing jobs, do not qualify under this category even if they imply a gain or loss of income.   Example: If a person is described as a high income person but as a description of them with respect to something else, such as their spending habits, then this is NOT relchanges. This category is for discussions of income/wages/earnings/compensation/wealth/etc. directly.    Example: If a particular type of job is mentioned, however, such as high wage jobs or low wage jobs, then this counts as a mention of income/earings/wages/etc. and thus as relchanges.   Relative comparisons of wages/income/benefits/etc between groups in same occupation or level and not in hierarchical relation to each other is relchanges and not relinequality. Treat this as changes in one group rather than multiple group mentions. Examples include workers in same occupation but unionized in one workplace and not in another, or bargained for higher  4 wages/benefits in one place but not in another, or contract and temporary workers versus full-time workers, or adults versus youth in minimum wage jobs, etc.   Vague mentions of tax cuts or increases or government spending increases/decreases without pinpointing groups should not be considered part of a multiple group article. If the article is mainly about stimulating the economy and cutting the deficit through all of these different mechanisms but no clear hierarchy of groups exists, then it should be relchanges.  What counts as mention of income/wages/etc.?  How would your calculation of income inequality change under this condition (whatever is mentioned in the article)? That is, ask yourself whether the particular issue mentioned has any implications for take home income, or income reported on taxes, or after-tax income, or total income paid by employer to employee but not reported by individual, such as employer contributions to health care or pensions, or income and in-kind assistance given by government, or transfers from family members, such as alimony/child support, or income earned from investments and property, etc. Discussions of wealth holdings that would not be claimed on income taxes on a year to year basis (only once sold) also count as income.  All of this is for *individuals* only because we are concerned about what affects the individual income distribution. Examples: general discussion of the stock market as an indicator of how the economy is doing is not going to be relchanges; it will be releconomy. In contrast, discussion of how the stock market is affecting individual investors will be relchanges. What affects individual annual individual income or wealth, then, is the question to ask yourself.  Examples: For the same reason, business tax increases or cuts are ambiguous, because some of those go to individual employer/owners but it is unclear exactly how much goes directly to employers as take home pay or income gains. Since this has unknown effects on the individual income distribution, I would not count it as a progressive or regressive tax unless the context makes clear that it is intended as one or the other. For example, if the purpose is to increase the progressivity of the tax code by increasing business taxes and decreasing middle class taxes, then this would be relinequality. By contrast, if the purpose is to stimulate investment by decreasing business taxes or providing investment tax credits, then this is about the economy (releconomy) and not about individual incomes. If employers are said to benefit individually by business tax cuts, then this would be relinequality because it is a regressive tax reform.   Consumption and spending have no effect on earned income; they are about spending income rather than earning income. Examples: discussions about inflation and consumer spending are releconomy but discussions about inflation leading to increases in wages in order to keep wages commensurate with inflation is relchanges. Or if income earned from investments are eroded by inflation, then this is relchanges as well. If inflation affects earned income, then it counts as relchanges.   Earned income from labor or from capital investments is the primary source of income for most individuals. Government is also a source of income, as in providing social security income, unemployment benefits, welfare assistance, in-kind assistance such as food stamps and Medicaid and housing subsidies, and tax credits, such as the Eearned Income Tax Credit.    What Counts as a Class/Income Group?   5 Treat “groups” broadly, as roughly quarters or thirds of the distribution: top, middle, bottom, or top, upper, middle, lower.   Multiple bottom groups should not be considered hierarchical groups (e.g., unemployed, welfare, min wage), unless the context strongly suggests hierarchy.   Average changes, such as for most Americans or the average American or “wage freezes” for wages (implying all those affected) can count as a group – the middle group. If other top or bottom groups are mentioned in the same article, then this could count as relinequality.    Multiple high end groups in different occupations, even if some are clearly more affluent than others, should also count as one group, unless strong relational language between them is being used.    Distinction between Releconomy and Relinequality/Relchanges   Relative comparisons of JOBS is not relinequality or relchanges. There must be a mention of high skilled or low skilled workers getting high wage or low wage jobs. There must be some mention of wages/income/etc. of jobs in order for the article to qualify as relinequality or even relchanges.  Relative comparisons of wages/income/benefits/etc between groups in same broad occupation or level and not in hierarchical relation to each other is relchanges and not relinequality. Treat this as changes in one group rather than multiple group mentions.   6. Mentions poor/lower (mentions the poor)   Additional notes: change to “Mentions poor/bottom”; include those on public assistance, qualified for means-tested programs, at bottom of income distribution, trouble finding and keeping jobs, disadvantaged populations/workers.   6a. Mentions working class (mentions working class)  Additional notes: change to “Mentions working class/lower”; include those in unionized jobs, blue collar jobs, low level service jobs, hourly workers, low-wage workers.    7. Mentions middle class (mentions middle class)  Additional notes: change to “Mentions middle class/average/median”; include average worker or families, median worker or family, mid-level white collar typically requiring college degree, supervisory workers.   8. Mentions rich/affluent/upper (mentions rich)  Additional notes: change to “Mentions rich/affluent/upper/high-income”; includes professionals and others designated “high income” (top decline, quintile, or even quartile) as well as super rich, top percentiles, the wealthy.  6 ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES: EXPLICIT/IMPLICIT AND ONEMENTION   This section discusses new coding categories beginning with recoding of “relevant – not sure” articles from previous batch (i.e., all articles given a code of relchanges or releconomy) and new articles from new keyword searches (beginning summer, 2010).   Onemention  If an article provides only a single mention of inequality or income in an article otherwise about the economy, then categorize as relinequality or relchanges and check the ONEMENTION category. Only do this for articles that are otherwise releconomy. In other words, do not use this for articles that have one mention of relinequality but otherwise would be relchanges. This would be relinequality. The purpose of this category is to flag those articles that are overwhelmingly about the economy/jobs/growth and not wages/income or inequality.    Explicit/Implicit   This category is to be used with relinequality articles. It is meant to flag the articles in which multiple groups are mentioned but not compared explicitly. In this case, the article would be coded as implicit and given a code of 0.  Explicit=1  There are three criteria: (1) hierarchical groups mentioned, (2) explicit relational language or direct comparisons among them are made, and (3) on the issue of income/wages/etc.  We are looking for the consequences/implications of certain policies or income/wage/earnings issues to be mentioned explicitly so that the reader does not have to infer the consequence for inequality. It is plainly stated, for example, that a flat tax hurts lower income people more than upper income people, thus increasing inequality. The mere statement of a policy that you know to be progressive or regressive does not qualify it as explicit inequality unless the implication of a progressive or regressive tax for income inequality is stated directly.  These are articles in which inequality is mentioned explicitly, either because the term inequality is used or other relational terms are used. Examples of relational terms are gaps, differences, us versus them, one group gains/wins and the other group loses, dual society, divides between groups, etc.   This includes any direct comparison of hierarchical groups even if groups are not clear economic groups but imply economic groups. Examples include politicians/lobbyists/special interests against regular people if the former are cast as economic elites; or least powerful or those with least clout gain the least/lose the most, etc. Populism is often used to signal relations between top and bottom, though that word alone does not necessarily count as relinequality. The contrast between Main Street and Wall Street is another oblique reference to relations between top and middle. All of these will likely count as explicit relinequality but use your judgement to make sure the groups are clearly compared to one another, typically in a zero-sum manner. Note there will be other terms that denote hierarchically related income groups. I cannot give an exhaustive list, so use your judgement about language that clearly references inequality between hierarchical income groups.  Other relational language can include the mention of one group only. Examples include one group that “benefits the most” or “loses the most,” as in taxes benefitting the rich most, even though there is no symmetrical mention of the poor losing the most. Or the “most extensive cuts” are to social programs, by  7 which is meant programs going primarily to the poor, then this would count as a relational mention between hierarchical groups. The mention of tax cuts benefitting one group or hurting one group also counts as explicit (e.g., the tax cut benefits the rich or hurts the rich). Language related to the decline of the middle class (“the middle class is endangered”) in which the middle class is singled out as having been hurt the most (or gained the most) also counts as explicit relational language. This would be true of other class/income groups as well.  Clear mentions of multiple groups in an article about income taxes can also count as explicit relinequality. Examples: rates for different groups are mentioned or there is a mention of one group getting more of a cut or more of an increase than another, even if not stated directly, and yet the figures are plainly given to that effect, then this would be explicit relinequality. The effect on inequality must be clear to the reader for this to count as explicit relinequality. Do not assume they know the implications of certain types of tax changes for the income distribution.   In general, tax issues most often raise the language of winners and losers and obviously deal with income. Social/government spending also often raises the language of winners and losers and deals transparently with income as well. Because these are distributive programs, if one group “wins”/”loses” then they are also put in a better/worse relative position by definition. This is why these mentions count as explicit relinequality.     Although many articles mention low skill and high skill workers, and even say that the low skilled are doing worse than the high skilled, this is not explicit enough language to automatically categorize in the explicit inequality category. The article must explicitly mention wages/compensation/benefits/etc with respect to these jobs, and there must be explicit language that one group is benefitting/losing more than the other(s).   If you are not sure if the language is explicit, then code as implicit and be consistent in your coding. DO NOT rely on the general context of the article to influence your coding. Explicit language must be present to justify a code of explicit inequality.  Direction of inequality may not be clear; it could be increasing, decreasing, or no mention or implication of either.   Explicit=0  These are articles in which the income/wages/compensation/wealth/etc of different, hierarchically organized groups are mentioned but there is no explicit relational language used. Examples: An article may mention that the investors are doing badly from the stock market; it may also mention that most Americans have lost out as well but in a different part of the article and there is no connection between the two. Everyone loses out and the direction of relative losses is not clear. Or there might be a mention of executive compensation and another mention of pension benefits declining for workers, but no explicit connection is made between these two.   Mentions of employers (even if bankrupt or in financial trouble), business profits and business tax cuts along with other group mentions (e.g., workers) would fit here too. Examples: If profits are good but worker benefits are being cut, this could be implicit because it doesn’t say that profits are going to benefit executives are those with the highest incomes in the companies (same with corporate taxes). We have to treat businesses as NOT an explicit top social group unless specific occupational or employer groups are mentioned as benefiting in terms of their incomes. On the other hand, it is relinequality because distributional issues are being discussed; that is, the distribution of profits to workers in the form of wages or benefits or other compensation.  So all wage bargaining and negotiating where workers and  8 managers/companies each clearly mentioned, but inequality is not explicitly mentioned as described in the explicit inequality section, would be implicit relinequality. Anti-union language (e.g., “union busting”) also does not count on its own as explicit relational language.  Examples: articles exclusively on business groups and including language like business populism should not be automatically treated as relinequality either. There must be an explicit mention of a policy that is said, explicitly, to benefit upper income groups to count as explicit relinequality. Otherwise, if favorable government policies for the business class are mentioned that clearly affect upper class incomes (most often taxes but corporate taxes alone don’t qualify here for above reasons), then code as implicit relinequality. Otherwise, an article only about business groups and not mentioning any specific income or earnings-related policies would be either irrelevant or releconomy if mentioned in relation to the state of the economy. Finally, if compensation is mentioned without any mention of government policies that affect compensation then categorize as relchanges.     In short, inequality and relational language between hierarchical groups must be explicitly stated in order to count as explicit relinequality. Otherwise, all other discussion of multiple hierarchical groups would count as implicit relinequality.   Gray Areas Related to Taxes and Government Spending  Tax changes that signal regressive or progressive changes if the regressive or progressive nature of the change is not stated directly could be considered either explicit or implicit.   Examples: a tax increase on the rich/wealthy/businesses/corporations or a tax decrease on the poor would signal a progressive tax and or a flat tax would signal a regressive tax but there is no mention of one group benefitting/losing more than another from the tax cut. Reagan’s tax reforms were all over the place, with some articles clearly mentioning benefits/losses to one group, thus signaling explicit relinequality, but other articles providing a dizzying array of tax cuts and tax increases (through elimination of loopholes) for everyone, signaling implicit relinequality.  All of these tax related articles with multiple groups mentioned should be categorized into the relinequality category and if the explicit criteria are NOT mentioned, then mark as implicit.  A simple mention of a regressive or progressive tax, without using those terms or any of the relational language specified under explicit relinequality, and no other language in the article about explicit inequality, should be categorized as implicit relinequality.  Examples: Mentions of cuts to social spending for bottom end groups or cuts to tax rates for the wealthy or capital gains without saying that one group benefits or loses would count as implicit relinequality. Thus taxes on the rich OR spending on the poor or other bottom end groups, including min wages, EITC, unemployment benefits, food stamps, welfare, and taxes, etc., should be treated in the same way when they are mentioned in an article without any other groups being mentioned.    These articles would be relinequality/implicit instead of relchanges because they are government policies that have direct redistributive consequences. However, we are looking for explicit relational language for it to count as explicit relinequality.    Examples: Vague mentions of tax cuts or increases or government spending increases/decreases without pinpointing groups should not be considered part of a multiple group article. If the article is mainly about stimulating the economy and cutting the deficit through all of these different mechanisms but no clear hierarchy of groups exists, then it should be relchanges.   9 SCHEMATIC SUMMARY OF MAIN CODING CATEGORIES SEPT. 23, 2010   What counts as an article on inequality?   Inequality, gaps, differentials, dual society, divides between hierarchical groups, and all other explicit mentions of income/earnings/wage/wealth inequality, though perhaps using other words than “inequality.”   These have been counted by first round coders as relinequality. This group will be given a separate code to denote their unique status as focused explicitly on the issue of income/earnings/wealth/etc. inequality.   What counts as explicit relational language and direction comparisons between hierarchical class groups?   Rich/top/wealthy/affluent vs. middle/poor/everyone else, Wall Street vs. Main Street, big business vs. unions/workers, high skill vs. low skill, high wage vs. low wage, high income vs. low income are the kinds of groups we are defining as hierarchical groups.  However, hierarchical groups must not only be mentioned but comparisons between them should be explicit, as in one benefits or loses relative to the other, or gets the most or least, or is hurt or gains the most or least, even if other groups are not mentioned.   And the loss or gain, benefit or disadvantage must be one of income/compensation/wealth/etc.   In short, there are three criteria: (1) hierarchical groups, (2) explicit relational language or direct comparisons among them, and (3) on the issue of income/wages/etc.  If you are unsure, place in the implicit relinquality category.  These articles are categorized as explicit relinequality in the second round of coding in which the explicit/implicit code was introduced.  What counts as implicit inequality?  Hierarchical groups and income/wages/earnings/etc. mentioned but no direct comparison of groups or explicit relational language is used.   Most often these articles include factual statements about changes or proposed changes in legislation (taxes, min wage, etc.) or in wage bargaining and other kinds of wage setting. They provide information about tax or wage/income/wealth changes for multiple groups in the income distribution but don’t spell out explicitly – i.e., they don’t say – that one group is benefiting/losing the most or relative to another group.    10  Mentions of wage bargaining/negotiating between workers and employers, government spending programs on the low income population, and taxes for particular groups are all distributive by nature and so they count as relinequality automatically. If explicit relational language and direct comparisons regarding income/wages/earnings/etc between hierarchical groups is not mentioned, then place in implicit relinequality.  This is second round’s implicit relinequality.  What counts as relchanges?  Any mention of income/wages/earnings/wealth regarding population as a whole or single broad group. Treat broad groups as including roughly quarters or thirds of the distribution: top, middle, bottom, or top, upper, middle, lower/bottom. No multiple, hierarchically related groups are mentioned in these articles.   Common examples include articles about wages for unionized workers or particular industries or workplaces that don’t mention bargaining or employers, or how investors are doing in the stock market, or how average wages and income are trending or whether there will be cuts in social spending programs or tax cuts or increases in general with no particular groups singled out.   Note that consumption related spending (as opposed to government spending) is not considered a mention of earned income/wealth/compensation/etc.   See detailed section on relchanges above for descriptions of what groups are and what counts as income.       Some special topics: how to categorize articles about…   1. Government vs. people: not relevant unless the government or politicians or special interests are clearly linked with or to an upper income group, such as the rich or powerful, etc.   2. Relchanges with a couple mentions in article mainly about releconomy: perhaps make a new category that says the relchanges is just about a general mention of income or wages for the population as a whole.   3. Historical references: if these are relevant, mentioning inequality or wages, then assume that they are pertinent to the year in which the article was written unless it is obvious that it is not mentioned in order to help describe the present circumstance.  	  	  	   11 APPENDIX	  B	  (“Annotations	  to	  the	  Coding	  Sheet	  –	  EK	  6-­‐30-­‐10	  –	  ljm.doc”)	   Coding Schema – Annotations by Leslie (June 30, 2010)  1. Irrelevant (if the article does not mention national economic conditions, changes in income/wage/earnings status or anything that falls under the inequality criteria)  Examples: note, in addition to above, that an article is irrelevant if it does not mention anything about income/wages/earnings and not just changes in such; articles not on the U.S.; articles on gender and racial inequality; articles on individuals or corporations that are not used as “examples” of something else related to releconomy, relchanges, or relinequality, such as stories on famous individuals/families or a criminal case or a corporate corruption case, etc. See “Coding Notes…” for additional description.    2. RelInequality (whether or not the article mentions income or class inequality – e.g., the gap between the rich and poor) Rising (whether the article mentions that inequality has risen or is rising or is discussing a policy that has the potential to increase inequality) Falling (whether the article mentions that  inequality has fallen or is falling or is discussing a policy with the potential to decrease inequality) Positive (whether inequality is a positive or good thing) Negative (whether inequality is a negative or bad thing)  Examples: any mention of one group doing better/worse than another group where the groups are at different points in the income distribution, such as the rich doing very well and the middle class or average American having a hard time keeping up with costs of living (education, health care), even if the two are not directly compared to one another (i.e., the article simply mentions both groups or types of individuals and their economic circumstances in different parts of the article without necessarily linking them together); mentions of changes are not necessary here.   3. RelChanges in income/wage/earnings status (whether or not article mentions changes in wages/income/earnings for particular class/income/worker groups but DOES NOT mention gaps between income groups (item 2)) Positive (whether this change is a positive or good thing) Negative (whether this change is a negative or bad thing)  Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”  4. RelEconomy(whether article mentions current national economic conditions with no mention of inequality or changes in wages/income/earnings for particular class/income/worker groups and DOES NOT mention inequality (item 2) or changes in wages/income/earnings for particular class/income/worker groups (item 3)) Improving (whether the article says conditions have improved or are improving) Worsening (whether the article says that conditions have worsened or are worsening)   12 Examples: inflation, interest rates, prices, cost of living, spending, stock market, government deficit, recession, expansion, jobless/jobloss recovery   *The above categories (1-4) are mutually exclusive – e.g., an article cannot be coded as being both RelInequality and RelEconomy.    5. Future/Prediction (this will be coded as “1” if any of the items 2, 3, or 4 are “predictions” for the future or the potential result of a policy. This distinction distinguishes between 1) the articles that mention past or present phenomenon in conjunction with causes/proposed solutions and 2) the articles that mention future/potential phenomenon in conjunction with policies).  Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”  6. Mentions poor/lower (mentions the poor)   Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”  6a. Mentions working class (mentions working class)  Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”  7. Mentions middle class (mentions middle class)  Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”  8. Mentions rich/affluent/ upper (mentions rich)  Examples: see notes provided in “Coding Notes…”                   13  Annotations to the Coding Sheet (by Elyse and Leslie) June 14, 2010  9. CauseUnskilled/Educ. (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be unskilled workers or lack of educated workforce) Examples: untrained/low skilled workers, education system not providing enough skilled workers, skills shortage, spending on education  10. CauseTax (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be tax policy) Examples: change in income tax rate, capital gains tax, investment/corporate taxes, tax credits, estate tax  11. CauseImm (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be immigration situation/policy) Examples: immigration bills, immigrants taking jobs, immigrants responsible for keeping wages low, immigrants needed for high tech jobs  12. CauseTech (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be changes in technology) Examples: technological changes requires higher skills/displaces those without skills, the expansion of the use of computers, rise of the Internet  13. CauseTrade/Outsourcing (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be trade or outsourcing policy or practice) Examples: loss of jobs to foreign competition, globalization, NAFTA, other trade agreements  14. CauseMinWage (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be status or changes in the minimum wage) Examples: increases/decreases in minimum wage, number of minimum wage jobs, minimum wage workers, living wages  15. CauseGovtReg (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be government regulatory practices of corporations) Examples: regulations regarding exec pay, unions, benefits, layoffs, job training, research and development; regulations of corp behavior through tax incentives; interest rate, inflation, and unemployment policy from the Federal Reserve  15a. CauseCorp/Bus/Emp (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4, to be corporate, business or employer practices) Examples: layoffs, downsizing, corporate practices, restructuring of businesses, temporary workers, cut backs/changes in employer-provided benefits, over time pay, actions regarding unionization efforts, employer-provided “on the job” training, price changes by private sector (e.g., oil industry)    14 16. CauseWelfare (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be welfare policy/practices) Examples: Medicaid and welfare policies, other means-tested programs for the poor, such as EITC  17. CauseSocSecurity (whether the article mentions the cause of any of items 2, 3, or 4 to be Social Security policy)  Examples: rising cost of Social Security and Medicare   18. Cause X (other causes – e.g, code as “1 – healthcare” if article mentions healthcare as a cause of any items 2, 3, or 4) Examples: unions (should have been separate category), rising cost of living, issues related to consumption costs (energy, health care, pensions, etc.).  19. PolJobTraining/Educ.

 Pam	  Keller’s	  notes	  	  • Part	  1:	  Main	  classification	  of	  article.	  o Irrelevant:	  Doesn’t	  discuss	  economy,	  wages,	  or	  not	  about	  the	  US.	  Even	  if	  it	  has	  one	  mention	  of	  something	  that	  could	  categorize	  it	  as	  one	  of	  the	  other	  categories,	  still	  categorize	  as	  irrelevant	  (ie.	  articles	  on	  individuals/businesses	  not	  representative	  of	  the	  whole).	  Conservative	  ideology	  classifies	  as	  irrelevant.	  o RelInequality:	  Mentions	  differences	  in	  wages/benefits/etc	  between	  groups	  OR	  policy	  affects	  one	  group	  more	  than	  another	  if	  all	  other	  conditions	  remained	  the	  same.	  Social	  programs/government	  spending	  (aimed	  at	  certain	  group)	  qualifies	  as	  RelInequality	  because	  they	  are	  distributive	  by	  definition.	  § Rising	  § Falling	  § Positive	  § Negative	  § Explicit:	  Indicates	  whether	  or	  not	  groups	  are	  compared	  explicitly.	  	  • Three	  criteria:	  mentions	  hierarchal	  groups,	  explict	  comparison,	  about	  wages/income/etc.	  	  • Implication	  of	  a	  policy	  must	  be	  stated	  directly,	  not	  just	  a	  mention	  of	  a

 if	  one	  group	  benefits	  disproportionately	  or	  if	  the	  rates	  for	  groups	  are	  given	  AND	  differ.	  • Needs	  to	  mention	  wages,	  not	  just	  low	  skill	  vs.	  high	  skill.	  o RelChanges:	  Any	  mention	  of	  wages/benefits/etc	  for	  groups,	  but	  doesn’t	  compare	  them	  or	  mention	  gaps.	  Does	  NOT	  include	  references	  to	  gaining	  jobs.	  Mention	  of	  “changes”	  to	  income	  for	  groups	  isn’t	  essential.	  Income	  includes	  stocks,	  government/individual	  transfers	  (ie.	  child	  support),	  or	  increased	  government	  spending	  NOT	  targeted	  to	  a	  central	  group	  (targeted	  spending	  would	  be	  RelInequality).	  Only	  consider	  individual	  income.	  	  § Positive	  § Negative	  o RelEconomy:	  Discusses	  economy,	  but	  not	  changes	  in	  wages	  or	  inequality.	  § Improving
