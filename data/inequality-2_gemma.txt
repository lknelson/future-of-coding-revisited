Here are the definitions of inequality articles, parsed from the provided text:

* **Explicit Inequality:** Articles must meet ALL THREE criteria:
    1. Mention **hierarchical groups**: Examples include rich/poor, top/bottom, high skill/low skill, Wall Street/Main Street.
    2. Use **explicit relational language**:  Phrases like "benefits more," "loses the most," "gap between," or direct comparisons of income/earnings/wealth are needed.
    3. Focus on **income/wages/compensation/wealth**: The comparison between groups must be about these economic factors.

* **Implicit Inequality:** Articles mention hierarchical groups and income/wages/etc., but *lack explicit relational language*. Examples include:
    * Factual statements about tax changes or wage bargaining affecting different income groups.
    * Mentions of government spending programs for low-income populations.
    * Discussions of taxes for specific groups without directly comparing their impact.

**Key Points:**


* Inequality articles are those that focus on the differences in income, wages, earnings, or wealth between distinct social groups.
* Explicit inequality is clearly stated, while implicit inequality is implied through the mention of relevant factors affecting different income groups.
