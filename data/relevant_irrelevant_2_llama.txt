Here are the bullet points summarizing the guidelines for coding explicit relinequality:

**Explicit Relinequality**

* Must explicitly mention income/wages/compensation/benefits/etc. of different hierarchical groups
* Must have relational language that one group is benefitting/losing more than another(s)
* Examples: tax issues, social/government spending that raises the language of winners and losers and deals transparently with income distribution

**Implicit Relinequality**

* Mentions income/wages/compensation/benefits/etc. of different hierarchical groups but lacks explicit relational language
* No clear connection is made between the groups mentioned
* Examples:
	+ Articles mentioning investors doing badly and Americans losing out, but no connection between the two
	+ Executive compensation and pension benefits declining for workers, but no explicit connection made
	+ Business profits and tax cuts along with mentions of other groups (e.g. workers)
	+ Wage bargaining and negotiating where workers and managers/companies are mentioned, but inequality is not explicitly mentioned

**Gray Areas**

* Tax changes that signal regressive or progressive changes, but the nature of the change is not stated directly
* Examples:
	+ Tax increase on the rich/wealthy/businesses/corporations or tax decrease on the poor (could be considered explicit or implicit)
	+ Flat tax (could be considered explicit or implicit)

**Key Principles**

* Do not assume implications of certain types of tax changes for income distribution
* Do not rely on general context of the article to influence coding
* Explicit language must be present to justify a code of explicit inequality
* Direction of inequality may not be clear; it could be increasing, decreasing, or no mention or implication of either.
