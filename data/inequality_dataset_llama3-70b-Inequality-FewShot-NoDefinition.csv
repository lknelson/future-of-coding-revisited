Bosses fight OSHA rules The way the business community is attacking the ergonomic regulations issued by the Clinton administration last week, you'd think ""ergonomics"" was a fancy word for ""in your face."" More than 50 companies and trade groups sued to stop the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. They said the rules would encourage worker malingering, hurt small businesses, and drive more American manufacturers overseas. Those are harsh charges about a rule, slated to take effect January 16, that would require companies to start addressing the plague of the modern workplace: repetitive stress injuries such as pained wrists from too much typing or aching backs from awkward lifting. Adjusting. The controversy isn't about the science of fitting work to people. With 600,000 Americans missing work each year because of repetitive stress injuries, about 16 percent of all workplaces have already adopted formal ergonomics programs. For example, at Cannondale Corp.'s Bedford, Pa., bicycle plant, workers now use adjustable stands for the vises that hold the frames. That means, says spokesman Tom Armstrong, that their nearly 7-foot-tall sander doesn't have to stoop and the 5-foot-5 sander doesn't have to reach. Cannondale thinks the minimal investment will pay for itself since workers are happier and worker compensation claims may drop. But even ergo-friendly businesses like Cannondale are fighting the new rules. They don't want to be responsible for a strain caused by, say, golf but aggravated at the office. And they oppose a clause that would make them pay injured workers 90 percent of net pay directly, rather than have them apply for workers' compensation. And then there's the cost. Business groups fear the regulations could cost companies $ 120 billion more than the $ 4.5 billion annual tab OSHA estimated. Baruch Fellner, the lead attorney against the rules, says the lure of easy pay and emphasis on reporting even minor pains might make workers imagine injuries. Industry research, for example, shows 90 percent of backaches go away on their own.""

How much does red ink really matter today? That's at the heart of a set-to that shows where Reagan's men stand. The latest round of bickering within President Reagan's economic brain trust gives this new glimpse into who's who in setting administration policy -- Treasury Secretary Donald Regan is still the President's No. 1 economic confidant. Martin Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, is in the doghouse. That became clear in late September as the White House tried to patch up a major split in its ranks. At the crux of the dispute lies this question: Will massive budget deficits keep interest rates high and scuttle the economic recovery? So serious is the squabbling that Reagan has personally admonished Regan and Feldstein to coordinate their views before making public appearances. That may not be easy. Regan cites a Treasury study that shows ''no necessary cause-effect link'' between deficits and interest rates. Instead, he cites other reasons why rates aren't dropping, including greedy financial institutions. But Feldstein reasons that unless legislative action is taken, deficits amounting to 1.2 trillion dollars will pile up between 1983 and 1988. That prospect, he says, is helping to keep interest rates high and could threaten the health of the economy. He wants Congress to raise taxes starting in 1985 or 1986, if that's what's necessary to trim deficits. Wall Street and many private economists support Feldstein's stand. ''Political question.'' It is Regan, nevertheless, who reflects the position of the President and most senior presidential aides. The White House wants no part of proposing major tax hikes with elections only 13 months away. ''The question isn't an economic one, but a political one,'' says one high official. The President on September 27 reiterated his long-held aversion to tax increases, labeling them ''shortsighted.'' While Regan enjoys the support of the White House, Feldstein isn't alone in his concern over huge deficits. Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is uneasy over the red ink. Budget Director David Stockman is leery, too. However, Stockman has limited impact on big policy decisions -- the residue of a 1981 interview critical of parts of Reagan's policy. Seen as closer to Regan than to Feldstein are Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Secretary of State George Shultz, an economist and onetime Treasury Secretary who is looked to by the President for broad economic judgments. Both enjoy warm personal ties with the President. Like Regan, they are considered loyal team players. What's sure is that the President himself will set final policy, and as of now he favors the Regan approach.""

Remember that economic report that George Bush crowed about in the campaign's last days, the one showing the economy had suddenly grown at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter? Skeptics quickly noted that the figure would probably be revised after the election. Sure enough, the Commerce Department last week changed its estimate -- and created an even bigger surprise. The rate was revised upward to 3.9 percent -- the best growth surge in nearly four years. That does not mean, however, that a true recovery has finally arrived. In fact, many economists contend that the seemingly healthy growth rate masks four sobering distortions: Business inventories rose sharply. That means much must be sold before production can be expanded. A big rise in federal purchases saw a $ 5.7 billion jump in government spending, compared with a $ 2.6 billion decline in the second quarter. The trade balance improved slightly, but it's threatened by an economic slowdown abroad, which is expected to check the growth of exports. Strong consumer spending is unlikely to hold up as wages keep sliding and unemployment remains high. Finally, there's concern about the reliability of federal statistics. Ever since Reagan-era cuts shrank the budgets of statistical agencies, economists have complained that policy makers lack the data to make wise decisions. Says Katherine Wallman, who heads a group that lobbies for improved federal statistics: ''There are all kinds of crises in government. This is one of them.""

NATION | SPENDING The Great American Divide High-end retailers such as Ralph Lauren and Tiffany used to be pretty good indicators of where the economy was headed: when people make more luxury purchases, it's a sign of financial confidence. Those two retailers and others like them have rebounded nicely from the recession, while midmarket stores like Gap are still mired. What's going on? Sales at top-tier retailers are now dominated by the wealthy, and the wealthy and the rest of us have been increasingly going our separate ways--a separation accelerated by the recession. The unemployment rate for people with a bachelor's degree or higher is 4.3%, less than half what it is for the nation as a whole. And the incomes of the top 1% (those earning $380,000 or more) are nearly as high as they were before the recession. The result is that the wealthy are spending again. According to Moody's Analytics, the top 5% of earners in this country now account for 37% of the spending, up from 25% two decades ago. And while that's enough to boost the fortunes of Tiffany and its ilk, it's not enough to boost the entire economy. As a result, the rest of us are moving down-market, buying more at low-cost stores like Family Dollar, creating a bifurcated retail market that serves two diverging Americas: the have-a-lots and the have-a-littles. As the middle class curtails spending, stores that cater to the wealthiest customers and bargain shoppers are doing the best These stores used to be aspirational. Now the rich are driving sales Middle-class shopping havens like Gap have struggled Trading down is the new trading up. This is where the middle class now shops NET SALES most recent quarter over same quarter last year PHOTO (COLOR) PHOTO (COLOR) ~~~~~~~~""

You can't always get what you want, especially in dealing with the economy, although today's low inflation and steady growth seem satisfying indeed. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the economy had actually expanded 4.9 percent during last year's fourth quarter, while the inflation rate was a modest 3.1 percent. But economic policymakers have long faced frustrating trade-offs among growth, inflation and unemployment -- and now it appears that a higher jobless rate may be here to stay. The Federal Reserve, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Congressional Budget Office all predict that the nation's overall unemployment rate will hover around 7 percent into 1987, not much below its current rate of 7.4 percent. Just a few years ago, that high a level would have seemed intolerable for long. So why has joblessness remained so intractable -- and why do many policymakers now seem reconciled to its lofty rate? For one, because it may seem bleaker than is actually the case. Economic growth has given an artificial boost to the unemployment rate, drawing back into the job market many so-called ""discouraged"" workers, who had given up looking for work and were not counted among the unemployed. What's more, 7 million new jobs have been added during this expansion, so more workers are employed now than at any time in the past. Still, by any standard, unemployment remains high -- and for two main reasons. There may now be more so-called ""structural unemployment,"" or joblessness resulting from such sweeping trends as changing technology, demographics or government policy. Moreover, the economy is still not functioning at full capacity. Despite the brisk expansion, the 1981-82 recession was so deep that the nation's factories, labor force and many other resources aren't yet being put to their fullest possible use. In part, this is because the Federal Reserve has reined in the growth of the money supply, restricting overall demand so as not to rekindle inflation. Sea Change: The question for policymakers is how much unemployment can be lowered without increasing inflation. Many economists have abandoned the belief that there is any fixed answer; they argue that the government should simply set its sights on keeping inflation down and holding growth steady, then let the jobless rate fall where it may. Effectively, this is the course the Reagan administration has elected. ""We're not satisfied with 7 percent unemployment . . . but we accept it,"" says William Niskanen of the CEA. ""It would be a mistake to target a [lower] rate of unemployment because it would mean [an] inflationary monetary policy."" Much of America seems to support that view. ""There is [little] worry about unemployment, as long as it is not rising -- and there is widespread concern about inflation,"" notes Brookings Institution economist Barry Bosworth. That is a sea change in American politics, and another reason why unemployed Americans may find it harder to land a new job.""

The rate ranged from 8.4 percent among adult women to 49.7 among black teenagers. The numbers out of work in large states also varied widely -- from 7 percent in Texas to 14.4 percent in Michigan. The July rate, released by the Labor Department on August 6, is the highest since May, 1941, when joblessness was 10.9 percent near the end of the Great Depression. The July rate was 0.3 percentage points above the June level. The 10.8 million jobless total is the largest such figure since 1934 -- and that does not count 1.5 million ''discouraged'' ex-workers who gave up any hope of finding jobs. Total employment dipped to 99.7 million.""
