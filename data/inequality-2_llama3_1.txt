Here are the bullet points summarizing the definition of inequality articles based on the provided document:

**Definition of Inequality Articles:**

* Mentions differences in wages/benefits/etc. between groups.
* Policy affects one group more than another if all other conditions remained the same.
* Social programs/government spending (aimed at certain groups) qualify as RelInequality because they are distributive by definition.

**Explicit Comparison:**

* Indicates whether or not groups are compared explicitly.
* Three criteria:
	+ Mentions hierarchical groups
	+ Explicit comparison
	+ About wages/income/etc.
* Implication of a policy must be stated directly, not just a mention of a progressive/regressive tax.

**Types of Inequality Articles:**

* RelInequality (Rising/Falling/Positive/Negative)
* RelChanges (Any mention of wages/benefits/etc. for groups, but doesn't compare them or mention gaps)
* RelEconomy (Discusses economy, but not changes in wages or inequality)

**Additional Notes:**

* Taxes count if one group benefits disproportionately or if the rates for groups are given and differ.
* Needs to mention wages, not just low skill vs. high skill.
* Mentions of cuts to programs or tax changes counts as implicit if it doesn't say one group benefits/is hurt.
