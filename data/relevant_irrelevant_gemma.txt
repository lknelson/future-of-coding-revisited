Here are the definitions of irrelevant articles, parsed from the provided text:

* **Articles not on the U.S.:**  The focus is specifically on economic issues within the United States.

* **Racial or gender inequality:** While important social issues, these topics are outside the scope of this coding project unless they intersect with broader economic trends (e.g., income disparities by race or gender).
* **Individuals whose names are part of a subject term:** Articles solely focused on a single individual's biography or experiences are irrelevant unless that person's story exemplifies broader economic conditions.

* **Popular culture references:** Mentions of movies, books, or other cultural works that include a subject term (e.g., "Big Business") are generally irrelevant.
* **Clearly personal affairs:** Articles about an individual's unique circumstances (not reflecting broader trends) are irrelevant.

* **Noneconomic elites:** Discussions of high status in fields like art, religion, or politics where economic standing is not a central theme are irrelevant.
* **Social class as a predictor of non-economic phenomena:**  Articles focusing on how social class relates to health, education, drug use, social mobility, or other non-economic outcomes are generally irrelevant.

**Exceptions:**

* Some articles on the above topics may still be relevant if they also mention trends in economic inequality. For example, an article about a famous individual's financial struggles could be relevant if it discusses broader issues of wealth disparity.
* Articles on policy debates or political figures can be relevant even if the primary focus is not on economics, as long as there are mentions of "relinequality," "relchanges," or "releconomy" within the text.
