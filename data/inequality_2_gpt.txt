- Inequality articles are those that discuss the relative differences in income, wealth, wages, compensation, benefits, etc. between two or more hierarchically ordered groups. This is coded as "relinequality".
- If an article mentions that tax cuts are proportionally greater for top than bottom or vice versa, affecting inequality, then it would be coded as "relinequality".
- If an article is mainly about unemployment or a growing or contracting economy but mentions earnings/income with respect to any group (even average American), then it should be coded as "relchanges" and not "relinequality".
- Articles about the stock market are relevant in that they discuss income (unearned income) primarily of those at the top end of the distribution. These articles would most likely be coded as "relchanges" but could also be "relinequality" in some instances if other hierarchically related groups are mentioned along with their incomes/earnings/wealth/etc.
- Articles that are overwhelmingly about the economy/jobs/growth and not wages/income or inequality are categorized as "releconomy".
- Articles in which multiple groups are mentioned but not compared explicitly are coded as implicit and given a code of 0. Explicit language must be present to justify a code of explicit inequality.
- Articles that mention low skill and high skill workers, and even say that the low skilled are doing worse than the high skilled, are not explicit enough language to automatically categorize in the explicit inequality category. The article must explicitly mention wages/compensation/benefits/etc with respect to these jobs, and there must be explicit language that one group is benefitting/losing more than the other(s).
- Tax changes that signal regressive or progressive changes if the regressive or progressive nature of the change is not stated directly could be considered either explicit or implicit.
