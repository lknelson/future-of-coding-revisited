* Stories that are not about the U.S.
* Articles on racial or gender inequality or gay rights in the U.S. (unless they also mention trends in economic inequality)
* Individuals whose names are part of a subject term (e.g., Marc Rich)
* References to popular culture that include part of a subject term (e.g., a movie named "Big Business")
* Clearly personal affairs about a single individual that do not comment on broader conditions
* Noneconomic elites (e.g., in art or religion or politics, where high economic status is neither implicit nor explicit)
* Social class as a predictor of non-economic phenomenon (e.g., health, education, drug use, social mobility, conspicuous and other kinds of consumption)
* Are about famous individuals or criminal cases or cases of corporate or union corruption that are treated as unique situations and do not have any reflection on broader conditions.
* Do not mention trends in economic inequality, even if they discuss policy or political debates and particular politicians.
* Articles that do not mention national economic conditions.
* Articles that do not mention changes in income/wage/earnings status or anything that falls under the inequality criteria.
* Articles not on the U.S. (i.e., articles about other countries).
* Articles on individuals or corporations that are not used as "examples" of something else related to releconomy, relchanges, or relinequality, such as:
	+ Stories on famous individuals/families.
	+ Criminal cases.
	+ Corporate corruption cases.
* Articles with a single mention of something that is relevant if the article is entirely on a different topic (e.g., conservatism as a subject keyword).
* Articles that use "Labor" as a subject keyword in conjunction with something else, such as Labor Education or Labor Mobility, unless they discuss job conditions and earnings of workers.
