Definition of Inequality Articles

* Economic/social class groups refer to individuals or groups differentiated by financial status.
* Financial status includes:
	+ Pay (wages, salary, bonuses)
	+ Non-cash compensation and perks (health benefits, pension plans, training benefits)
	+ Investment income (stocks, bonds)
	+ Wealth and assets (home ownership, savings)
	+ Income and non-cash transfers from the government (taxes, welfare, food stamps)
	+ Income and non-cash transfers from private sources (child support)

**Broad Economic/Social Class Groups**
* Defined roughly as quintiles, quarters or thirds of the distribution:
	+ Top, middle, bottom
	+ Upper, middle, lower, bottom
	+ Executives, managers, supervisors, workers, laborers, clerks
* May also be defined by occupations, such as:
	+ Unemployed, minimum wage workers, recipients of anti-poverty assistance

**Hierarchically Related Economic/Social Class Groups**

* Two or more broad groups that are in a hierarchical/vertical relation to each other:
	+ Top and bottom, rich and poor, upper and middle
	+ Employers and employees, managers and unions
	+ High-wage workers and low-wage workers

**Articles about Inequality**

* Must mention economic/social class groups explicitly or implicitly.
* May discuss changes in economic groups, but this is not required.
* Examples of articles that qualify as being about inequality:
	+ Discussions of policies that affect specific economic groups (e.g., tax cuts for the rich)
	+ Articles that compare the economic circumstances of different groups (e.g., the wealthy vs. the poor)
	+ Stories about government programs or policies that target specific economic groups (e.g., welfare reform)

**Sub-Categories**

* Rising: articles that mention inequality is rising or discuss policies that have the potential to increase inequality.
* Falling: articles that mention inequality is falling or discuss policies with the potential to decrease inequality.
* Positive: articles that present a positive perspective on changes in income, employment, or economic conditions.
* Negative: articles that present a negative perspective on changes in income, employment, or economic conditions.

**Other Categories**

* Future/Prediction: articles that predict future trends or outcomes related to inequality.
* Mentions poor/lower: articles that mention the poor or lower-income groups explicitly.
* Mentions working class: articles that mention the working class or lower-middle-income groups explicitly.
* Mentions middle class: articles that mention the middle class or average-income groups explicitly.
* Mentions rich/affluent/upper: articles that mention the rich, affluent, or upper-income groups explicitly.

* Mentions differences in wages/benefits/etc. between groups.
* Policy affects one group more than another if all other conditions remained the same.
* Social programs/government spending (aimed at certain groups) qualify as RelInequality because they are distributive by definition.

**Explicit Comparison:**

* Indicates whether or not groups are compared explicitly.
* Three criteria:
	+ Mentions hierarchical groups
	+ Explicit comparison
	+ About wages/income/etc.
* Implication of a policy must be stated directly, not just a mention of a progressive/regressive tax.

**Additional Notes:**

* Taxes count if one group benefits disproportionately or if the rates for groups are given and differ.
* Needs to mention wages, not just low skill vs. high skill.
* Mentions of cuts to programs or tax changes counts as implicit if it doesn't say one group benefits/is hurt.
