Here are the key definitions for identifying articles about inequality, based on your provided document:

**Core Criteria:**

* **Economic/Social Class Groups:** Articles must mention distinct economic groups (e.g., rich vs. poor, working class vs. middle class). These groups can be explicitly named or implied through relational language.
* **Hierarchical Relationship:** The groups mentioned must have a clear vertical relationship (one group is "better off" than the other).

**Types of Inequality Mentions:**

* **Explicit Mentions:** Articles directly state that one group is doing better/worse than another, often using comparative language (e.g., "the gap between rich and poor," "income inequality widening").
* **Implicit Mentions:**  Articles mention policies or trends that disproportionately benefit certain groups without explicitly stating the inequality. For example:

    * Tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy.
    * Social program cuts impacting low-income individuals more severely.

**Additional Indicators:**

* **Changes in Income/Wealth:** Articles discussing changes in income, wages, benefits, or wealth for different economic groups are strong indicators of inequality.
* **Government Policies:** Mentions of policies aimed at redistributing wealth (e.g., progressive taxation) or addressing social disparities often signal inequality concerns.
