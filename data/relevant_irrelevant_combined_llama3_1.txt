* The article mentions popular culture that includes part of a subject term (e.g. a movie named "Big Business"), but does not discuss economic inequality.
* The article discusses clearly personal affairs about a single individual that do not comment on broader conditions.
* The article is about noneconomic elites (e.g. in art or religion or politics), and high economic status is neither implicit nor explicit.
* The article uses social class as a predictor of non-economic phenomenon (e.g. health, education, drug use, social mobility, conspicuous and other kinds of consumption).
* The article discusses famous individuals or criminal cases or cases of corporate or union corruption that are treated as unique situations and do not have any reflection on broader conditions.
* Articles that do not discuss national economic conditions, changes in wages, or income.

* Conservative ideology articles.

Note that if an article mentions trends in economic inequality, income inequality, or has qualifying text on relinequality, relchanges, or releconomy, it will not be considered irrelevant.
